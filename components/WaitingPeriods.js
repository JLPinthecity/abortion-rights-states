            As of August 2022, 30 states require the gestational age of the
            fetus be disclosed during counseling. Twelve states require
            counseling cover information on the fetus's ability of a to feel
            pain, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Five states require
            that patients be told that personhood begins at conception. This
            information may be considered misleading.
